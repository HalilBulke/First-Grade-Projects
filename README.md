# First-Grade-Projects
## General info
These are my first year lab assignments as a computer engineering student. I started learning programming with these assignments, so they can contain bugs and unnecessary codes. 

* First term we entered the programming in Introduction to Programming I course using Python.

* Second term we entered the object oriented programming in Introduction to Programming II course using Java.

To understand contents of the assignments and running examples you should examine the assignment instructions from the assignment pdfs.
